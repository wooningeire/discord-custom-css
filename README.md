# Custom Discord CSS
Experimental stylesheet that made some visual tests to Discord's UI, including
* multi-column server list
* higlighted channel category names (with smaller top margin)
* blurple highlighting of the selected channel
* circular server notification badges

Likely will not work anymore due to class names containing mangling in later versions of Discord.
